Stack is one of the linier data structure
It's follow a LIFO(last in first out)
Here we call add the data to stack is push and remove data to stack is pop
Here data is push to stack at one end and pop the data from the stack at same end


Ex:
# Python program to
# demonstrate stack implementation
# using list
  
stack = []
  
# append() function to push
# element in the stack
stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')
  
print('Initial stack')
print(stack)
  
# pop() function to pop
# element from stack in
# LIFO order
print('\nElements popped from stack:')
print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())
  
print('\nStack after elements are popped:')
print(stack)
  
# uncommenting print(stack.pop())
# will cause an IndexError
# as the stack is now empty

OutPut:

Initial stack
['a', 'b', 'c']

Elements popped from stack:
c
b
a

Stack after elements are popped:
[]
