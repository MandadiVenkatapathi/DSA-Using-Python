Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the certain order

Working:

Suppose we are trying to sort the elements in ascending order

First Iteration (Compare and Swap)

Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.

If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.

Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.

The above process goes on until the last element.

program :

def Bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)-1-i):
            if arr[j]>arr[j+1]:
                temp=arr[j]
                arr[j]=arr[j+1]
                arr[j+1]=temp
                
arr=[10,5,26,46,586]
Bubble_sort(arr)
print('Sorted Array in Ascending Order')
print(arr)

Output:

Sorted Array in Ascending Order

[5,10,26,46,586]
