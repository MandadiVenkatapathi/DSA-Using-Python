Merge Sort Algorithm:

Merge Sort is one of the popular sorting algorithms that is based on the princple of divide and conquer algorithm 

Here, a problem is divide into multiple sub-problems .Each sub problem is solved individually.finally sub-problems combined to form the final solution

Implementation of program:

def merge_sort(arr1,arr2):
    arr=[]
    i=j=0
    while(i<len(arr1) and j<len(arr2)):
        if arr1[i]<=arr2[j]:
            arr.append(arr1[i])
            i+=1 
        else:
            arr.append(arr2[j])
            j+=1 
    while(i<len(arr1)):
        arr.append(arr1[i])
        i+=1 
    while(j<len(arr2)):
        arr.append(arr2[j])
        j+=1 
    return arr 
arr1=[1,2,3,4]
arr2=[5,6,7]
print(merge_sort(arr1,arr2))

Output:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
